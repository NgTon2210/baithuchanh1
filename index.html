                                What is a sports car? A car may be a sporting automobile without being a sports car.

                                A sports car, or sportscar, is a small, usually two-seater, two-door automobile designed
                                for spirited performance and nimble handling. The term "sports car" was used in The
                                Times, London in 1919. According to USA's Merriam-Webster dictionary, USA's first known
                                use of the term was in 1928. Sports cars started to become popular during the 1920s.

                                Traditional sports cars were typically two-seat roadsters.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Although the first sports cars were derived from fast tourers, and early sporting
                                regulations often demanded four seats (even three-seaters were often produced by
                                coachbuilders), two seats became common from about the mid-1920s. Modern sports cars may
                                also have small back seats that are often really only suitable for luggage or small
                                children; such a configuration is referred to as a 2+2 (two full seats + two
                                "occasional" seats).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Over the years, some manufacturers of sports cars have sought to increase the
                                practicality of their vehicles by increasing the seating room. One method is to place
                                the driver's seat in the center of the car, which allows two full-sized passenger seats
                                on each side and slightly behind the driver. The arrangement was originally considered
                                for the Lamborghini Miura, but abandoned as impractical because of the difficulty for
                                the driver to enter/exit the vehicle. McLaren used the design in their F1.
